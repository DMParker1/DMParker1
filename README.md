# Daniel M. Parker — spatial epidemiology, medical geography, and anthropology

**Field-grounded medical geographer & anthropologist** with strong epidemiological credentials — equally at home with satellite data and community narratives. I work at the intersection of **infectious disease, mobility, and marginality**, with a growing emphasis on the **spatial politics of health**.

- 🧭 Core: spatial epidemiology • political & medical geography • mixed methods
- 🛰️ Methods: GIS/RS (QGIS/Google Earth Engine), R/Python, Bayesian & GAMs, small-area estimation
- 👣 Field: GMS/Thailand–Myanmar border, Ethiopia (Dire Dawa/Gambella), SE Asia, refugee/migrant health
- 🗣️ Outputs: papers + public essays, maps, talks, teaching

**Highlighted work**
- 🚨 *Dire Dawa Urban Health & Mobility*: EO + spatial risk + routine surveillance  
- 🗺️ *Myanmar Border Mapping Archive*: a methods and cartography record  
- 🧰 *Spatial-Epi Methods*: reusable R/Python notebooks and utilities  
- 🌍 *EO for Health*: night-lights, settlement growth, heat/flood exposure pipelines  
- 📚 *Political Ecology & Health (teaching)*: slides, labs, assignments  
- ✍️ *Global Health Field Notes*: short essays & annotated maps
