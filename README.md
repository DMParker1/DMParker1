# Daniel M. Parker

**Field-grounded medical geographer & anthropologist with strong epidemiological credentials** — equally at home with satellite data and community narratives. My work sits at the intersection of infectious disease, mobility, and marginality, with a growing emphasis on the spatial politics of health.
