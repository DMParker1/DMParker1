# Daniel M. Parker

**Field-grounded medical geographer & anthropologist with strong epidemiological credentials** — equally at home with satellite data and community narratives. My work sits at the intersection of infectious disease, mobility, and marginality, with a growing emphasis on the spatial politics of health.

This preserves my legitimacy in infectious disease epidemiology, aligns with my passion for geography and anthropology, and lays the foundation for my future as a public intellectual and author.
