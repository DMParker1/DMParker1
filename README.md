# Daniel M. Parker

I am a spatial epidemiologist, medical geographer, and anthropological demographer working at the intersection of infectious disease ecology, mobility, and marginality. My research blends anthropological, demographic, and geographic methods to examine how human behavior and environmental factors shape disease dynamics, with particular focus on Southeast Asia.
